#JCommons

----------
This is a general Java toolkit focused on some common aspects of reusable Java components. The goals of the project are speed, efficiency, and an easy to use Java API.

The **JCommons** project is mainly composed of three parts:

1. Commonly used Utils such as processing of `String`, `Date`, `Regex`, etc.
2. File read and write, including the `xml`, `pdf`, `ms office`, `json` parsing.
3. Net utils for quick implementation of file downloading and html parsing.

Note: This project cares more about **usability** rather than **efficiency**.

Some features are still under implementation...
